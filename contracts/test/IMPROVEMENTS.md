# Test Suite Improvements

## Changes Made

1. **Created Shared Helper Contracts**
   - Extracted common test helper contracts to `helpers/MosaicTestHelpers.sol`
   - Removed duplicate storage contract implementations
   - Standardized helper contract names

2. **Resolved Naming Conflicts**
   - Renamed helper contracts to avoid identifier conflicts
   - Used consistent naming patterns across test files

3. **Added Documentation**
   - Created README.md with instructions for running tests
   - Documented test structure and test case coverage

4. **Fixed Import Conflicts**
   - Properly imported OpenZeppelin's ERC721 contract
   - Used MockNFT in place of generic ERC721 mock to avoid conflicts
   - Ensured consistent imports across test files

## Future Improvements

1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Add more edge case testing
   - Test more error conditions and revert scenarios

2. **Refactor Testing Utilities**
   - Create more shared testing utilities for common operations
   - Extract common test setup logic

3. **Gas Optimization Testing**
   - Add tests to measure gas usage of key operations
   - Set gas usage baselines and test for regressions

4. **Fuzz Testing**
   - Implement property-based testing using Foundry's fuzzing capabilities
   - Test with a wide range of inputs to find edge cases
